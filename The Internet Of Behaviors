The Internet of Things (IoT) is defined as a source connecting any electric device to the internet. 
The smart world has obtained devices like mobile, computer or tablets to stay at the electronic hype. 
Henceforth, IoT is no longer a part of some sci-fi movie or drama. 
The collection of usage and data by the IoT devices provides valuable insights into users’ behaviours, interests and preferences, something which has been coined as the Internet of Behaviour (IoB). 
The emerging technology is expected to open numerous possibilities in business, personal finance, workplace and much more. 

Using the same level of connection and integration as the IoT, the IoB hones in on individual user actions (for example, when a user browses or interacts with a free mobile app) 
to fill in potential knowledge gaps and paint more vivid panoramic consumer profiles.

Based on this notion, it’s possible to break down the IoB into 3 definitive fields:

~ Deep data analytics
~ Technological interaction
~ Behavioral science

By gaining this deep level of connective behavioral insight, companies or institutions can personalize their services to an incredible extent,
meeting consumer needs and developing innovations more effectively than ever before.
